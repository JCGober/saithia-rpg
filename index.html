          <p>
            Saithia is the perfect world. From the the northern mountains where thunder resounds to the thick jungles of the far south, 
            it’s teaming with wildlife, bountiful resources, and to those who are sensitive to them — Arcane Particles.
            <br>
            <br>
            You are a member of the Tribe of Lor, one of the many groups of nomads that have travelled Saithia 
            since the dawn of time -however short ago that was. You and your closest friend, Corinthe lead the Lor. 
            You protect them from carnivorous beasts, you decide where they migrate to, and you care for your flock 
            as best you can. The two of you, along with Corinthe’s wife, Ellora, are different from the rest of 
            your tribesmen. The three of you are Arcane sensitive. You three wield the dangerous and mysterious 
            art referred to as ‘magic’. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Magic is an valuable skill. Little is know about it and anyone who can wield it is considered a pioneer. 
            You, Corinthe, and Ellora have been working together to discover all that you can accomplish with it, 
            and so far you are learning that it’s possibilities are endless. 
            <br>
            <br>
            You three are not the only ones who can wield the Arcane. Their are other tribes with members 
            who can use it as well. Others that could threaten your tribes very existence. 
            <br>
            <br>
            As you navigate the dangers of Saithia and delve into the art of magic you begin to feel a pull. 
            A pull to the center of the world. A magical presence that promises unyielding power in the arcane. 
            The only thing that stands in your way? The rise of civilization.</p>

          <legend>Chapter 1: Preparations for heading East</legend>
          <p>
            You still think we should head East?” Corinthe asks as he approaches you. You’re staring across the water, 
            turning over the magical particles that surround you. They are invisible, and only those sensitive to the magic 
            can feel them. Using them you had sensed Corinthe’s presence long before he had arrived.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Yes.” You reply, almost exasperated. “Our people are scared. We have stayed for far too long this time. 
            The wild bears are becoming emboldened. It won’t be long before we bury another one of our friends.” 
            <br>
            <br>
            Corinthe nods hesitantly. “So you think we should follow the pull in the magic?”
            <br>
            <br>
            It was now your turn to hesitate. Over the past several weeks you and Corinthe had elected to start a small 
            settlement on the bank of a beautiful bay. The fishing is great, the deer are abundant, and the wildberries omniscient. 
            With the surplus of food available to your tribe you had been able to dedicate a great deal of time to studying magic. 
            With that new found knowledge also came a pull. A pull to the east, where a great unknown arcane power had made 
            itself known. 
            <br>
            <br>
            “Yes. What have we to lose?” 
            <br>
            <br>
            Corinthe looks down the slope to a gathering of 9 huts near the water front. Men are carrying fishing 
            nets along the shore. Women hauling baskets filled with wild produce. A few children run around a fire. 
            <br>
            <br>
            “Need I say more?” A women dressed in leathers starts walking up the slope towards the two of you. It’s Ellora.
            <br>
            <br>
            “The two of you gonna be useless? Or have you decided on a plan?” She asks. You and Corinthe both smile. 
            <br>
            <br>
            “It seems like we’ve decided to head East.” Corinthe volunteers. 
            <br>
            <br>
            “Towards the pull?” Asks Ellora. “Then I guess we better start preparations for the journey.”
